Rules of the game:
A game has n players and n decks. Every player and deck has 4 cards. At the start of the game the cards are distributed in a round robin fashion to all the players. Once all players have 4 cards, the remaining cards are distributed in a round robin fashion to the decks  ensuring every  deck and player has 4 cards. To win the game a player must have 4 cards of the same numerical value. Assuming a player hasn’t won the game, when it’s their turn they must remove one of their cards and place it on the deck to their left and then pickup a new  card from the deck to their right. This process is repeated until there is a winner.

A game begins with the user typing in how many players are to play the game. After a positive integer has been typed in, the game requests a pack file. This pack file must contain 8 cards for every player.

To run the test suite open the project in Visual Studio Code and run the Test Runner Extension.
