/* TASKS TO DO:
     * *DONE* player input and test validity 
     * *DONE* pack file input and validity
     *  player threads created
     *  new card object created and written to pack file
     *  cards are distributed to make list of hands and decks for each player (NOTE: Order is 1 card to each player in a round robin until 4 cards, then decks )
     *  output file is made for players and the decks EACH
     *  wincondition checked upon each player, if no win is made
     *  atomic action of drawing, checking win condition and discarding for player threads
     *  atomic action of drawing from top of deck and add from bottom of deck
     *  wincondition is met and player that has one notifies other players so game is stopped
     * Synchronise file writing
